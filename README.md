## Notes for the future
* Implement personalized user so multiple people can log on and view
their own todo lists
* Implement a back end storage to store each todo list in a calendar
like page so users can backtrack what they listed on their todo lists
* Implement a delete function to delete tasks that were submitted by
mistake
* Implement a verification protocol that checks whether task is empty 
and if so, to not add it to prevent users from creating too many empty
tasks
* Implement a button/tab that enables users to switch from the normal
todo list to the work todo list
